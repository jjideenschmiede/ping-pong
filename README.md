# Ping Pong

This small wordpress plugin creates a new api endpoint, through which you can play ping pong with the system. This function is known for example from redis databases.

the api endpoint is available at the following url:

```console
http://localhost/wp-json/ping/pong
```

[Here](https://github.com/jjideenschmiede/ping-pong/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) you can download the ZIP file and add it directly to your wordpress installation.
